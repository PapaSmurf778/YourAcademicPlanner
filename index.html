    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      We’ve been in your shoes—busy, overwhelmed, and trying to juggle it all. As former varsity athletes, we faced the challenge of
      balancing rigorous academic demands with the commitments of university life. It wasn’t easy, but by staying organized and
      managing our time effectively, we achieved academic success while excelling as members of our respective varsity teams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, we want to share what worked for us. Our mission is to help students take control of their academic lives, find balance,
      and unlock their full potential. Whether you’re striving to improve your grades, pursue passions outside the classroom, or simply
      reduce stress, we’re here to help you turn chaos into confidence. Success isn’t just about working harder—it’s about working
      smarter. Let’s make it happen together!
